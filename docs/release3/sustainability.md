# Reflection on Sustainability Aspects of the Project

In developing Maple Breeze Retreat, a conceptual spa booking app, we emphasized integrating sustainability principles across environmental, social, and economic dimensions. While the app is not yet intended for actual use and currently lacks fully functional implementations, it has been designed with potential end users in mind. Using SusAD (Sustainability Awareness Diagram) as a framework, we analyzed the app’s impacts at immediate, enabling, and structural levels to ensure it aligns with sustainable practices.

From an environmental perspective, we focused on reducing resource usage and minimizing the app’s environmental impact. The backend structure retrieves only the necessary data, such as bookings for specific dates, instead of transferring the entire database to the frontend. This design reduces API calls and lowers server energy consumption, contributing to decreased CO₂ emissions. Over time, such optimization could significantly reduce resource use if the app were scaled. Additionally, digitization eliminates the need for paper-based processes like physical calendars and receipts. By only generating receipts upon user request, the app reduces waste and avoids unnecessary data storage. This approach aligns with SusAD’s environmental dimension, which prioritizes efficient resource and energy management.

At an economic level, we explored how the app could create value and streamline workflows. Automated features, such as digital reminders like validation if the information does not meet the requested standards, would reduce operational overhead while freeing employees to focus on other work, like customer service. These improvements align with SusAD’s enabling level, where automation enhances workflow efficiency and reduces resource costs. If implemented, these features could provide long-term economic sustainability while improving user and employee satisfaction.

From a social perspective, we prioritized trust and inclusivity in the app’s design. The app collects only the necessary information; name, email, type of treatment and date,  and assigns a unique booking ID to securely manage data without relying on sensitive personal identifiers. This practice enhances user trust and demonstrates a commitment to privacy. Over time, the app could establish stronger norms around secure and transparent data handling. By fostering trust and providing a user-friendly interface, the app aligns with SusAD’s social dimension, which emphasizes inclusivity, accessibility, and trust-building.

At the individual level, the app was designed to offer users more control over their interactions. For instance, users have the option to request receipts, empowering them to make conscious choices that align with their preferences. Such features reflect SusAD’s individual dimension, which highlights autonomy, privacy, and the ability to act freely within a system.

From a technical perspective, we focused on designing a solution that is maintainable, scalable, and robust. The use of modular, efficient code minimizes redundancy and reduces energy consumption. This also ensures that the app can be adapted or expanded in the future to meet evolving user needs. These technical decisions align with SusAD’s technical dimension, which emphasizes maintainability, security, and scalability to ensure a system’s long-term sustainability.

Although Maple Breeze Retreat is currently a conceptual project without real-world functionality, it has been designed to simulate how such a solution could be used by end users. By applying SusAD, we have demonstrated how sustainability principles can inform the development of digital tools. The app illustrates how intentional design choices can reduce environmental impact, build trust, and create value, while ensuring technical robustness. While not yet a practical application, this project serves as an example of how digital solutions can contribute to a more sustainable future.

# Welcome to group 16's repository!
 
This is the repository of group 16. 

Here, you will find the group project of the course IT1901 Informatikk prosjektarbeid 1.


## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for our JavaFX application project.

### Purpose of the app

We have created an app that will function as a spa booking page. The app contains functionality where you can write your name and email address, book which treatment you want and which date is suitable for the treatment. All this information gets stored in a json-file and and this information is also saved on a server using our REST API. The server is built with Spring Boot, which processes incoming booking requests and stores the data centrally, allowing easy retrieval and management of all bookings. This setup ensures that bookings are accessible and consistent across different devices or clients interacting with the system.

More information about the app and release 3 in this [Readme.md](booking/docs/release3/readme.md).

## Functionalities
**The functionalities in our app as of now**:
- You input your name and email
- You pick one treatment from a dropdown-list
- You pick a date for your treatment
- When you press the “order” button, your order is validated and saved to file
- A confirmation page shows up when the order is received
- You can close the app from the confirmation page with the “close application” button or go to a receipt page with the "Show receipt button"
- The receipt page shows your order, and if you have previous orders with the same email, they will also be displayed.

## Necessary versions and dependencies

This app uses Java version 17.0.1 and maven version 3.8.0
